DESCRIPTION:
AI-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING JAVA. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO CREATE A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE CAPABLE OF SUGGESTING PRODUCTS OR CONTENT TO USERS BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE PROJECT USES APACHE MAHOUT, A SCALABLE MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY THAT ENABLES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLABORATIVE FILTERING TECHNIQUES.

THE SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED USING JAVA AND FOLLOWS A USER-BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING APPROACH. THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN USERS IS CALCULATED USING PEARSON CORRELATION, AND BASED ON THIS, THE ENGINE RECOMMENDS ITEMS TO USERS THAT ARE LIKED BY SIMILAR USERS. THE RECOMMENDATION ENGINE READS INPUT DATA FROM A CSV FILE (D.CSV), WHICH CONTAINS SAMPLE USER-ITEM RATINGS.

THE PROJECT FOLDER CONSISTS OF THE JAVA SOURCE FILE (RECOMMENDATIONENGINE.JAVA), THE MAHOUT LIBRARY FILE (MAHOUT-CORE-0.9.JAR) STORED IN THE LIB/ DIRECTORY, AND THE SAMPLE DATASET. THE CODE IS COMPILED AND EXECUTED BY LINKING THE MAHOUT LIBRARY THROUGH THE COMMAND LINE USING THE JAVAC AND JAVA COMMANDS. UPON RUNNING, THE ENGINE OUTPUTS A LIST OF RECOMMENDED ITEMS FOR A SPECIFIED USER, ALONG WITH ESTIMATED PREFERENCE SCORES.

THIS TASK DEMONSTRATES THE INTEGRATION OF MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS INTO JAVA APPLICATIONS AND SHOWS HOW APACHE MAHOUT CAN BE USED TO BUILD INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS.
